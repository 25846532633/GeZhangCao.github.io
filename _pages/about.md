I am a first-year graduate student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests lie in natural language processing, knowledge graph construction, and intelligent information retrieval systems. I have a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and database systems, and I am passionate about leveraging AI technologies to solve real-world problems.

Previously, I graduated with outstanding academic performance and actively participated in various innovation competitions and projects, which strengthened my practical skills and collaborative spirit. I am now looking forward to exploring deeper into AI and machine learning during my graduate studies.
